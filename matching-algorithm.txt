How The Matching Algorithm Works
Each question has two parts:
	1. 5 multiple choice responses with 5 being the extreme on one end and 1 being the extreme on the other end
	2. 4 options for how the user wishes the person they are matching with to respond
The multiple choice questions are set up as follows:
	1 -> 1
	2 -> 3
	3 -> 6
	4 -> 9
	5 -> 11
The importance is rated as follows:
	1 -> 1
	2 -> 2
	3 -> 4
	4 -> 5
For each question:
	take both users multiple choice option and |x2-x1| => xScore
	take both users importance and y2+y2 => yScore
	Then:
	Match the (xscore, yscore) to the correct match score for that question
	{range from 1 -> 64 with a unique number for each possible score}
	Then:
	weight the current question with the appropriate question wait and add the score to the running total
	Finally,
	Add the id and associated score to the result map
After the map has been created:
	sort the map in accending order to get the correct match ranking
Finally:
	store the map in the DB
