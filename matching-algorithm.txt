How The Matching Algorithm Works
Each question has two parts:
	1. 5 multiple choice responses with 5 being the extreme on one end and 1 being the extreme on the other end
	2. 4 options for how the user wishes the person they are matching with to respond
The multiple choice questions are set up as follows:
	1 -> 1
	2 -> 3
	3 -> 6
	4 -> 9
	5 -> 10
The importance is rated as follows:
	1 -> 1
	2 -> 2
	3 -> 4
	4 -> 5
For each question:
	take both users multiple choice option and |x2-x1| => xScore
	take both users importance and y2+y2 => yScore
